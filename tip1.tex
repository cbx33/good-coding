\chapter{Tip 1 - First things first}
\subsection{(or Why didn't you tell me that in the first place)}

Consider the following conversation;

\begin{trenches}
Alvin: I've got an issue with my computer.

Bryan: What seems to be wrong?

Alvin: It doesn't print when I ask it to.

Bryan: Have you tried turning the printer off and on again?

Alvin: Yes.

Bryan: Have you reinstalled the print drivers?

Alvin: Yes.

Bryan: Can you hook it up to another computer and try it?

Alvin: No, I've run out of ink.
\end{trenches}

It's down right infuriating isn't it, when

\begin{code}
import re
import sys

a = [3,4,5,6,7]

for i in a:
	print "hi" + str(a)
\end{code}

\begin{callout}{Remember}{You don't get nothing for free}
There is always some compromise
\end{callout}
